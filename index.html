  <h1>information about apple store</h1>
  <p>The Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. The stores sell, service and repair various Apple products, including Mac desktop and MacBook laptop personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.
      The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with 
   consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two
   physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly 
    successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion
    in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail 
     locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 529 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide,
     opening its latest store in Shanghai, China on March 21, 2024 with one another planned store in the USA.[1][2]
     Strong product sales have 
    placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.</p>
